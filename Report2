The objectives of this program were to create a simple calculator able to do
operations in including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
The calculator was meant to be able to turn on and off when the user wanted
and recognize these different operations and perform them in a while loop.  The
calculator was also meant to store previous data for two previously calculated
answers.

The main variables needed for this were "on" the variable that started the
calculator while loop when hitting 1, "opp" where the user inputs a symbol
to conduct the if statements for the applicable operation.  Each operation
had similar variables, each named slightly different to distinguish them from
each other although meant to recognize numbers and operation symbols and
perform the operations.  The "off" prompts stop the calculator and are used
with "break" to break the while loop.

To extract numbers from the strings, I used the find method, which located the
operation symbol in an entered expression for the addition and subtraction
sections.  I then used a range in correlation to the identified operation
symbol and the numbers before it and after it, no matter how many were entered.

As for errors, in the multiplication and division sections I could not get
the same find method to work as it kept giving me errors.  So I simply split
the code for more possible user inputs and made it work.  I could not figure
out how to store previous replies properly, I kept getting errors that my list
would not work so I removed it altogether to avoid messing up the code.
Initially the subtraction section kept adding the numbers together until I
figured out that the "diff" section needed to remain as a plus and not a minus
because the minus cancelled out the find operation and added them because of a
double negative.
